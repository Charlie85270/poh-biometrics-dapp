# Proof-of-Humanity using Biometrics

## Idea Scope

Creating an additional plugin for verifying humanity using Apple/Android/Windows device biometrics as Proof-of-Humanity. 

## How It Works:

When using the Plugin, users are prompted for their biometrics.

Succesful completion of the biometrics login produces an authorization.

HUMAN Protocol verifies the transaction on-chain with the user's identity.

## Roadmap:

Frontend: 
Metamask or Rainbow Kit integration. 

Passage Biometric Authentication implementation to send proof data to the Validator API

Backend: 
Creating a Biometric Validator API that will generate a PoH proof on verification or revert.
Creating a smart contract that verifies the PoH  generated by the validator.

## Install Dependencies & Run Backend/Frontend

Backend dependencies
```bash
cd backend/
npm install
node server.js
cd ..
```

Frontend dependencies
```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run start
cd ..
```

The application will run on http://localhost:3000, which you can navigate to in your browser.
